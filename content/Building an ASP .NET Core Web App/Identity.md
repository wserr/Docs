# Usage in the application

ASP.NET Core Identity [^1]
- Is an API that supports user interface (UI) login functionality.
- Manages users, passwords, profile data, roles, claims, tokens, email confirmation, and more.

## Usage in this application

As stated in the intro, I want to use Identity to allow for users to log in and see their reminders, but the users can't register themselves. 

## Plan of action

To develop this functionality, I will fork the Identity project and create my own branch. You can find this branch here TODO WIS link zetten.
